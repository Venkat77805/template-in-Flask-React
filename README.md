Project Introduction
It is a project for the assessment of the Associate Software Engineer (Python/React) position at Better Software. It shows my competency in developing scalable, maintainable software using React and Flask, adhering to good engineering principles.

**Objective**
Task 1: Develop backend APIs to create, update, and delete comments for a specific task based on good CRUD principles.

Task 2 (Bonus): Create a frontend UI to add, edit, and delete tasks using the provided CRUD APIs.

**Tech Stack**
Backend: Flask, SQLAlchemy, Pytest

Frontend: React, Axios

Database: SQLite (for local development)

**Highlights**
Modular code organization with Flask Blueprints

RESTful API design with error handling

Automated tests for all comment-related endpoints

Clean React components for task management

Clear separation of concerns between backend and frontend

This project demonstrates my style of writing tidy testable code and constructing full-stack applications with a solid groundwork for future scalability
