 **template-in-Flask-React**
Project Introduction
This project is part of the assessment for the Associate Software Engineer (Python/React) role at Better Software. It demonstrates my ability to build scalable, maintainable software using Flask and React, following solid engineering principles.

**Objective**
Task 1: Build backend APIs to add, edit, and delete comments for a given task using proper CRUD principles.

Task 2 (Bonus): Build a frontend interface to add, edit, and delete tasks using the existing CRUD APIs.

**Tech Stack**
Backend: Flask, SQLAlchemy, Pytest

Frontend: React, Axios

Database: SQLite (for local development)

**Highlights**
Modular code structure using Flask Blueprints

RESTful API design with proper error handling

Automated tests for all comment-related endpoints

Clean React components for task management

Clear separation of concerns between backend and frontend

This project reflects my approach to writing clean, testable code and building full-stack applications with a strong foundation for future scalability
